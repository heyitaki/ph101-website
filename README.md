# PH101 Website
True story- 

I took Public Health 101 at UC Berkeley as the last requirement of senior year. Although I P/NPed the class (the vast majority of my time went towards [Archer](https://github.com/archerimpact), so I had no time for class), I was still in danger of failing. I should mention over the course of the entire semester, I went to 1 lecture, 1 discussion, and submitted neither of 2 essays in this attendance-based class. 

Rather than having me make up all the work I hadn't submitted and class I had missed, my professor allowed me to create a website for the class instead. This website was a 1-hour effort during an Archer meeting and exists as a monument to every bad habit I cultivated in college. Inspired heavily by a fantastic [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/overflow) template :)
